                        These questions are what led me to explore the impetus of a composition using set theory. This analysis process was initially intended to analyse a finished piece in a reverse-engineering-like process. But why not apply it to an isolated instance of a short motif or group of notes?

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The groups of notes that result from such exploration are then grouped in three sets which I call the Tonic group, the Subdominant group and the Dominant group. I lifted these three words straight out of tonal music and ignore completely the baggage that they carry from there (unless it is advantageous for my composition to make use of such baggage). The organisation of these three groups is based on the axis-tonality that I learnt from Bart&#243;k.

                        music, technology and teaching, Anthony currently practices as an independent music professional,

                        Anthony studied music in Malta, Italy and the UK. He obtained his PhD in Music from the University of 
                        Surrey where his research concentrated on various aspects of the compositional process, elements of 
                        sound design, and experimental audio software tools.

                        He developed a technique to generate new musical material from an initial idea which is based on 
                        Allen Forte's set theory analysis technique and researched various experimental software for audio

                        Slide 2 is concerned mainly with the idea of time as it is crystallised in music by the barline and the usually fixed lengths of the bars.
                        Here, accents move around. Phasing has been explored in styles related to minimalism, and electronic music. A classical example of of phasing is Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti's <em>Po&egrave;me Symphonique for 100 metronomes</em>. Other composers have battled the tyranny of the barline. Some names to 
                        mention include Stravinsky and Carter, who is renowned for his metric modulations.
                    </p>
                    <p>In slide 2 I wanted to juxtapose the different positions of the accents, and in fact, the piece start with the accent misplaced when compared to the meter of the music.
