## UXD

This is the latest incarnation of my website. Its main function is to be an extension of my CV and having a place of contact if someone wants to get in touch but does not know my email address.

**Strategy** - Project aims (what to achieve) and target audience
Design strategy + Business strategy


can be broken down into three main areas of interest so you've got the focus
what's worth doing the definition what are we creating? and value what value
does it provide? so for example in terms of focus you're a software developer
looking for work opportunities, you're looking for projects, collaboration ideas,
contract work and working with startups for example. You decide to build an

* Usage Context - Where
* User Constituency - Who
* Business Goals - Why / Targets

Internet presence  
Means to communicate with me  
Portfoilio  
Brief info about my activities

**Scope** - (based on information from the strategy plane) Which features will be include in the design? Which features are in and which is out (at least for now)? Minimum Viable Product

* User Tasks - A User Story is used to describe a number of tasks that may be completed in an any order in pursuit of a general goal.


Ex: allow people to request collaboration, provide a traditional CV or resume
download option for recruiters or more traditional employers. In terms of
content you might decide on providing personal details also a personal pitch
for collaborators, your work history, a summary of your skill sets, maybe some
groups meetups and conferences that you have attended or a part of and also the
projects that you've undertaken so in terms of these content requirements how
do they provide value well you've done some research
recruiters say they wanted a traditional CV format downloadable possibly a PDF so
you can supply your content in that format. Agencies want proof of ability so
the resume itself stands as proof and everybody wants to see your github
repository. 

at the scope level we decided on our features and our content so that
features for example are the ability to request a collaboration and the ability
to download our resume in a more traditional format and the content will
be working with personal details, a personal pitch, work history, skill set
summary, groups, meetups and organizations that the developer is a part of and the
projects undertaken. 

**Structure** - Structure and logical grouping of the information

Interaction Design / Information Architecture

* Navigation / Routing

projects undertaken. Interaction design is concerned with patterns and sequences
that provide options to the user the patterns might be the navigation, the
order of the menu items, the navigation we tend to read from left to right so
you might want to prioritize your top level information on the on the left
with diminishing priority as you moved from left to right. You might decide on
the relationships between the information you might decide that
personal information should go beside a personal pitch. You might decide that
work history sits really well with skills summary. You might decide that the
request for a collaboration go on its own area you might decide that the
developer is a part of and finally priority six is the ability to download
a CV. Next having put the bulk of the tasks and assignments required at the



**Skeleton** - Representation of the information, Navigation around the site to locate the information and reach the features.
Content relationship / Priority (position of content)

Responsive design


the two key areas
of interest here are interface design and navigation design. 
Interface design
is concerned with the best arrangement and visual presentation of the elements
navigation design is concerned with intuitive navigation and the completion
of tasks. At this point we also create what are called mock-ups. Mock-ups give us a
good idea of how well constructed our information architecture is and also the
arrangement of our features.

Placement of things
Ex: we'll place our navigation in the upper region which is common and conventional

so based on our
information architecture we prioritized our personal info and our pitch as being
priority one so when a prospective employer arrives at your site for the
first time they'll immediately be able to determine your personal info and your
personal pitch we arranged these also using roughly the law of thirds so the
personal info takes up one third of the width of the screen and the pitch takes
up two thirds. The same arrangement is put in place for the profile image
and the name, the title and the menu items associated with a developer and we
maintain that structure and arrangement throughout the site. The header and the
footer are the same and our main content areas the shape of those areas is the
same what's changed is the actual content. This reassures the user they've already
been exposed to this pattern on the home page now in the resume page this pattern
is repeated so the work history takes up one third, my skills takes up two thirds
now while they project submission our project request form is slightly
different it's still balanced we still have the header at the top we still have
the footer at the bottom the navigation hasn't changed also in terms of
navigation let's go back here the priority of our content is reflected in
the navigation so home represents our personal info on our pitch that's on the
left and then we move to resume to contact to download CV now you might be
wondering well there's only four menu items here where is the links to our
github repositories and the links to meetups and our organizations and so on
well the reason they're not shown here is because in this particular module
we're using solely CSS and HTML now we are using bootstrap as well with it but
only in the context of CSS and HTML itself for the grid in the next module
we'll build up our JavaScript skills to the point where we can implement the
meetups and they github repositories because those sections will require
JavaScript and having carried out the tasks the activities and the information
gathering an organization across the strategy, the scope, the structure and the
skeleton planes we then move on to the final plane which is the surface






**Surface** - Look and feel of the finished product; Colors, Typography; Images; Design Elements - animations, transitions, effects
Monochromatic with some contrasting collors for CTA (buttons). Use gradients in background to avoid the monotony of a flat gray background. 
Use parallax background in alternating sections to create interest and break the grey background.



The surface is the most concrete plane this is what the user gets to see the final
product so it's concerned with color, typography,
effects and imagery. It tries to reinforce the meaning of the
content and guide the user to tasks and information in an intuitive way. It's
also concerned with minimising cognitive overload and maximizing intuitive
learning and it's also concerned with the appropriate content.

example  dark band on the top a dark band at the bottom so our
header and our footer have similar colors and they will be repeated across
the homepage, the resume, the contact
The content itself our main content across each page
will take the format of 1/3 and 2/3 
providing a visual balance 
we've also
split our footer information into thirds as well so we have another about me
another opportunity to download the CV and the social icons which could link to
Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn and so on
